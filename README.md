***NOTE:*** this fork is **deprecated**, and will be removed soon. Please, refer to [https://github.com/kpavel/openwhisk-light](https://github.com/kpavel/openwhisk-light) instead (which provides similar functionality in conjunction with an unmodified version of node-red-node-openwhisk).

Instructions for working with the original node-red-node-openwhisk package can be found in https://github.com/ibmets/node-red-node-openwhisk/blob/master/README.md
